          A big part of our experience on SAKTA is focused on how fast the site
          can load and how good it looks, and I think this is why so many users
          love it. When you hit sakta.it, it loads fast! That's by design.
          Providing our users with a simple and beautiful place in a crowded
          World has always been top of mind for us. Every new feature we
          implement is focused on performance and how our users can find any
          inspiration they're looking for, distraction-free. This is it. Good
          inspiration will make you better at what you do. I know for a fact I
          am a better designer when I am inspired. We designed a platform
          without ads and tracking, because we believe our users should be able
          to explore creativity and culture without being sold something they
          are not interested in or having their data collected without their
          consent. Our feed is curated by humans, always with an eye on the
          World and culture, with relevant and up-to-date inspiration and we are
          constantly improving and listening to feedback from our main
          ambassadors, our users. And I thought this photo of Steve I saved
          recently from the book LoveFrom (Jony Ive design studio) just
          published this week it's a great reminder to keep pushing.
